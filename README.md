# Lari Lending Smart contracts 
**L**east Autho**RI**ty Lending, or **Lari Lending**, is a lending protocol built on top of agoric's blockchain. 
The focus of the project is the application of the Principle of Least Authority to provide users with a cross-chain lending platform that provides users with offer safety. 



# Running the code
### Requirements
* Node.js v14.15.x
* agoric-sdk installed.

## Getting started
Inside a command-line prompt, (terminal, iterm, etc.), execute the following.

```sh
~/home % git clone https://github.com/aw3l/lari-lending-contracts && cd $_
# install the project dependencies
~/home/lari-lending-contracts % yarn install 
# run test code to view current scenarios beind handled
~/home/lari-lending-contracts % npm run test
```
If all goes as it should, the result should look like the screen recording below. Note that `npm run test:watch` will watch for changes in a specific directory, and then re-run any tests once changes are detected.
